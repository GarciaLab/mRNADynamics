findBrightSpots:
	Threshold value is set to infinity. Will save Mexican-hat filtered
	images in the diagnostic folder and exit.

	Inspect these in ImageJ to determine the threshold value to use.
	The ideal threshold value T is the highest such that every true spot
	has at least 2 shadows brighter than T. As a rule of thumb, a good
	threshold to use is the brightness of the dimmest spot that, by eye,
	you still believe to be a shadow of a true spot rather than noise.

findBrightSpots:
	Threshold value is set to infinity. Will save Mexican-hat filtered
	images in the diagnostic folder and exit.

	Inspect these in ImageJ to determine the threshold value to use.
	The ideal threshold value T is the highest such that every true spot
	has at least 2 shadows brighter than T. As a rule of thumb, a good
	threshold to use is the brightness of the dimmest spot that, by eye,
	you still believe to be a shadow of a true spot rather than noise.

findBrightSpots:
	Threshold value is set to infinity. Will save Mexican-hat filtered

	Inspect these in ImageJ to determine the threshold value to use.
	The ideal threshold value T is the highest such that every true spot

	you still believe to be a shadow of a true spot rather than noise.

findBrightSpots:
	Threshold value is set to infinity. Will save Mexican-hat filtered
	images in the diagnostic folder and exit.

	Inspect these in ImageJ to determine the threshold value to use.
	The ideal threshold value T is the highest such that every true spot
	has at least 2 shadows brighter than T. As a rule of thumb, a good
	threshold to use is the brightness of the dimmest spot that, by eye,
	you still believe to be a shadow of a true spot rather than noise.

findBrightSpots:
	Threshold value is set to infinity. Will save Mexican-hat filtered

	Inspect these in ImageJ to determine the threshold value to use.
	The ideal threshold value T is the highest such that every true spot
	has at least 2 shadows brighter than T. As a rule of thumb, a good
	threshold to use is the brightness of the dimmest spot that, by eye,
	you still believe to be a shadow of a true spot rather than noise.

findBrightSpots:
	Threshold value is set to infinity. Will save Mexican-hat filtered
	images in the diagnostic folder and exit.

	Inspect these in ImageJ to determine the threshold value to use.
	The ideal threshold value T is the highest such that every true spot
	has at least 2 shadows brighter than T. As a rule of thumb, a good
	threshold to use is the brightness of the dimmest spot that, by eye,
	you still believe to be a shadow of a true spot rather than noise.

findBrightSpots:
	Threshold value is set to infinity. Will save Mexican-hat filtered
	images in the diagnostic folder and exit.

	Inspect these in ImageJ to determine the threshold value to use.
	The ideal threshold value T is the highest such that every true spot
	has at least 2 shadows brighter than T. As a rule of thumb, a good
	threshold to use is the brightness of the dimmest spot that, by eye,
	you still believe to be a shadow of a true spot rather than noise.

findBrightSpots:
	Threshold value is set to infinity. Will save Mexican-hat filtered
	images in the diagnostic folder and exit.

	Inspect these in ImageJ to determine the threshold value to use.
	The ideal threshold value T is the highest such that every true spot
	has at least 2 shadows brighter than T. As a rule of thumb, a good
	threshold to use is the brightness of the dimmest spot that, by eye,
	you still believe to be a shadow of a true spot rather than noise.

findBrightSpots:
	Threshold value is set to infinity. Will save Mexican-hat filtered
	images in the diagnostic folder and exit.

	Inspect these in ImageJ to determine the threshold value to use.
	The ideal threshold value T is the highest such that every true spot
	has at least 2 shadows brighter than T. As a rule of thumb, a good
	threshold to use is the brightness of the dimmest spot that, by eye,
	you still believe to be a shadow of a true spot rather than noise.

findBrightSpots:

	The ideal threshold value T is the highest such that every true spot

findBrightSpots:

	The ideal threshold value T is the highest such that every true spot

findBrightSpots:
	Threshold value is set to infinity. Will save Mexican-hat filtered

	Inspect these in ImageJ to determine the threshold value to use.
	The ideal threshold value T is the highest such that every true spot

	you still believe to be a shadow of a true spot rather than noise.

findBrightSpots:
	Threshold value is set to infinity. Will save Mexican-hat filtered

	Inspect these in ImageJ to determine the threshold value to use.
	The ideal threshold value T is the highest such that every true spot

	you still believe to be a shadow of a true spot rather than noise.

findBrightSpots:
	Threshold value is set to infinity. Will save Mexican-hat filtered

	Inspect these in ImageJ to determine the threshold value to use.
	The ideal threshold value T is the highest such that every true spot

	you still believe to be a shadow of a true spot rather than noise.

findBrightSpots:
	Threshold value is set to infinity. Will save Mexican-hat filtered

	Inspect these in ImageJ to determine the threshold value to use.
	The ideal threshold value T is the highest such that every true spot

	threshold to use is the brightness of the dimmest spot that, by eye,
	you still believe to be a shadow of a true spot rather than noise.

findBrightSpots:
	Threshold value is set to infinity. Will save Mexican-hat filtered
	images in the diagnostic folder and exit.

	Inspect these in ImageJ to determine the threshold value to use.
	The ideal threshold value T is the highest such that every true spot
	has at least 2 shadows brighter than T. As a rule of thumb, a good
	threshold to use is the brightness of the dimmest spot that, by eye,
	you still believe to be a shadow of a true spot rather than noise.

findBrightSpots:
	Threshold value is set to infinity. Will save Mexican-hat filtered

	Inspect these in ImageJ to determine the threshold value to use.
	The ideal threshold value T is the highest such that every true spot
	has at least 2 shadows brighter than T. As a rule of thumb, a good
	threshold to use is the brightness of the dimmest spot that, by eye,
	you still believe to be a shadow of a true spot rather than noise.

findBrightSpots:
	Threshold value is set to infinity. Will save Mexican-hat filtered
	images in the diagnostic folder and exit.

	Inspect these in ImageJ to determine the threshold value to use.
	The ideal threshold value T is the highest such that every true spot
	has at least 2 shadows brighter than T. As a rule of thumb, a good
	threshold to use is the brightness of the dimmest spot that, by eye,
	you still believe to be a shadow of a true spot rather than noise.
