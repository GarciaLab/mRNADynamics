Plan for writing stitching code:

1) Write code for stitching two images in left right orientation of the
same size along the stitching axis. Don't include any code specific 
infrastructure for accessing metadata in this iteration. 

2) Write code for stitching two images in top bottom orientation of the
same size along the stitching axis. Don't include any code specific 
infrastructure for accessing metadata in this iteration.
