function FluoTimeTrace = extractDorsalFluo(FluoMatrix, Thresh)

% Arguments:
% FLUOMATRIX is a txz matrix of fluorescence values where t is frames and z
% is Z slice. It corresponds to the 'schnitzcells(i).Fluo' field in the schnitzcells struct
% THRESH corresponds to the quadratic coefficient in the parabola we fit to
% fluo(z). .5 works. 

% Output 
% FLUOTIMETRACE is a tx1 vector of nuclear fluorescence values.

% it classifies each frame in 'schnitzcells(i).Fluo' in three different categores,
% which represent the three different ways the Dl nuclear fluorescence 

% Case 1: the nuclear fluorescence is upwards pointing parabola In this
% case a line of y = fluo(z) looks kind of like a parabola pointing up. In this
% case we calculate max(fluo(z)). This is basically what we do for any
% other nuclear protein.

%Case 2: the nuclear fluorescence is downwards facing parabola In this
% case a line of y = fluo(z) looks like a parabola pointing down. In this
% case we calculate min(fluo(z)). 

%Case 3: the nuclear fluorescence is flat. In this
% case a line of y = fluo(z) looks roughly flat. In this
% case we calculate the median(fluo(z)). 

% The way a fluo trace is assigned to one of these categories is by
% fitting a parabola such that fluo(z) = az^2 + bz + c.
% the first coefficient 'a' indicates the orientation of the parabola and
% is the one that we apply 'THRESH' to.
