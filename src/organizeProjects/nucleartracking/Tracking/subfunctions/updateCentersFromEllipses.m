%UPDATECENTERSFROMELLIPSES Takes an Ellipses structure and outputs an 
% updated of the centers structure.

% There are two ways to use it :
%
%   centers = updateCentersFromEllipses(Ellipses)
%
%   centers is a new structure that contains only the center coordinates of
%   all ellipses.
%
%   centers = updateCentersFromEllipses(Ellipses,centers)
%
%   updates the centers structure by just adding or removing the centers
%   that were not present in both structures, Ellipses and centers.
